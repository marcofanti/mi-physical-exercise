        prompt = """Your task is to evaluate whether the Counselor's responses align with the Client's motivation concerning a specific topic, target (self or others), and aspect (risk or benefit). Determine if the Counselor's statements effectively motivates the Client. Your analysis should be logical, thorough, and well-supported, providing clear analysis at each step.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task better:
## Example 1:
### Input
Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
- Counselor: Hello. How are you?
- Client: I am good. What about you?
- Counselor: I'm doing well, thank you. I understand you wanted to talk about your alcohol consumption. Can you share a bit more about how you're feeling about it?

The Motivation of Client is as follows:
- You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in relation to depression for yourself, as alcohol could worsen your depression.

Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

### Output
Analysis: The Counselor's initial statement focuses on building rapport and asking the Client to share their feelings about alcohol consumption, but it does not directly address the Client's specific motivation—the risk of alcohol exacerbating depression. Since the Client is motivated by the personal risk of worsening depression, an effective motivational approach would involve acknowledging that risk and connecting it to the Client's emotional or mental health concerns. The Counselor’s statement lacks any mention of the risks or the Client's depression, making it less likely to effectively motivate the Client in this context.
Answer: No


## Example 2:
### Input
Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
- Counselor: Are you surprised what that might be true?
- Client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.
- Counselor: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?

The Motivation of Client is as follows:
- You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in sports for yourself, as alcohol would affect your ability to play soccer.

Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

### Output
Analysis: The Counselor's statement addresses various risks associated with alcohol use, including its potential impact on the Client’s role in life and goals, particularly in sports. Since the Client's motivation revolves around the risk of alcohol affecting their ability to play soccer, the Counselor’s mention of how alcohol could interfere with sports aligns with the Client's concern. By highlighting this specific risk, the Counselor's statement effectively taps into the Client’s personal motivation, making it more likely to encourage behavior change.
Answer: Yes


## Example 3:
### Input
Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
- Counselor: It sounds like you're considering making some changes around your alcohol consumption. What makes you think it might be good to cut back?
- Client: I guess I just want to be more mindful of my health and well-being.
- Counselor: It sounds like you're considering making some positive changes for your health. What are some reasons that are motivating you to cut back on alcohol?

The Motivation of Client is as follows:
- You are motivated because of the risk of drinking alcohol in relation to depression for yourself, as alcohol could worsen your depression.

Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

### Output
Analysis: While the Counselor’s statement touches on the Client’s general motivation to improve their health, it does not specifically address the Client's key motivation—the risk of alcohol worsening their depression. The Counselor asks broad questions about the Client’s reasons for cutting back on alcohol, but fails to connect directly to the Client’s concern about depression, which is a central aspect of their motivation. For the statement to effectively motivate the Client, it would need to focus more on the specific risk of alcohol impacting their mental health.
Answer: No

## Example 4:
### Input
Here is the conversation snippet toward reducing alcohol consumption:
- Counselor: It seems like you're concerned about staying productive at work, but drinking regularly could have some negative effects. Alcohol can make it harder to stay focused and might even cause you to miss deadlines or make mistakes. Have you noticed any of those risks affecting your productivity?
- Counselor: Not really, I still get my work done, and I don’t feel like my drinking is hurting my performance. I mean, I can still function well enough, so I don’t think it’s a problem.
- Counselor: That makes sense, but over time, regular drinking can slowly take a toll on your ability to perform at your best. You might not notice it now, but it could lead to more mistakes or slower work in the future. Are you worried that alcohol could start to interfere with your productivity in the long run?

The Motivation of Client is as follows:
- You are motivated because of the benefit of reducing alcohol consumption in terms of productivity for yourself, as you feel more productive when you don’t have a hangover.

Question: Can the Counselor's statement motivate the Client?

### Output
Analysis:The Client is motivated by the benefit of increased productivity without alcohol, but the Counselor focuses on the risk of future productivity loss from drinking. The Counselor’s focus on potential risks doesn't align with the Client's motivation, which is based on the immediate benefit of feeling more productive when avoiding alcohol. To be more effective, the Counselor should have highlighted the benefit the Client already experiences.
Answer: No
